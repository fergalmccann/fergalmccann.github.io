<p> The Committee for the Global Financial System (CGFS) produced an extremely useful report on borrower-based macroprudential measures. 
  Along with colleagues Niamh Hallissey and Elena Durante, I contributed to the work of the group on behalf of the Central Bank of Ireland. 
  The final report contains both country case studies and an overarching paper on lessons from the experience of a wide range of jurisdictions with varying tools used, institutional contexts, and objectives.  </p>
 <p> You can read it at this <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs69.htm">LINK</a>  </p>

  <p> I had the great pleasure of speaking at another event with similar aims: a conference to mark the creation of the Research Handbook on Macroprudential Policy, hosted by David Aikman at King's College London in 2024. </p>
  <p> I presented a summary of close to ten years of research on borrower-based measures in Ireland, joint with Edward Gaffney and Niamh Hallissey, at the event. </p>
  <p> The programme offers a rich and broad set of insights for anyone with a research interest in the field.  </p>
 <p> The conference landing page is <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/research-handbook-macroprudential-policy-conference-2023">here</a>. Watch out for the handbook in published form later!  </p>
