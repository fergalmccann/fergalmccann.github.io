    <p> <u> Conference in honour of former Governor Patrick Honohan   </u></p>

<p> I was extremely honoured to contribute to a paper on financial sector policy in Ireland as part of conference proceedings to mark the contributions of our former Governor Patrick Honohan to Irish public life. 
The work, co-authored with Central Bank colleagues Laura Boyd, Niall McGeever and Tara McIndoe-Calder, looked at the evolution of savings and investment in the Irish economy, and the role played by the financial system in intermediating between the two. 
The paper will be published in the Economic and Social Review in 2025 </p>

    <p> <u> Basel's CGFS reporting on borrower based measures   </u></p>

<p> The Committee for the Global Financial System (CGFS) produced an extremely useful report on borrower-based macroprudential measures. 
  Along with colleagues Niamh Hallissey and Elena Durante, I contributed to the work of the group on behalf of the Central Bank of Ireland. 
  The final report contains both country case studies and an overarching paper on lessons from the experience of a wide range of jurisdictions with varying tools used, institutional contexts, and objectives.  </p>

   <p> <u> The Research Handbook of Macroprudential Policy   </u></p>
  <p> I had the great pleasure of speaking at another event with similar aims: a conference to mark the creation of the Research Handbook on Macroprudential Policy, hosted by David Aikman at King's College London in 2024. </p>
  <p> I presented a summary of close to ten years of research on borrower-based measures in Ireland, joint with Edward Gaffney and Niamh Hallissey, at the event. </p>
  <p> The programme offers a rich and broad set of insights for anyone with a research interest in the field.  </p>
